Created this 'backup' project to continue work.

The context of the situation is that my laptop is down and I cannot access the local_setting.py which contains the SECRET_KEY and DATABASE for the project. Without these I cannot open the virtual environment needed to effectively work on the project.

My goal here is to refactor and add functionalities to the project, until my laptop is working and I will attempt to 'merge' the projects together.
